  **In this project we will build Support-Vector-Regression Model to the prediction of Salary from different features in Position_Salaries dataset**.<br></br>
  SVM regression or Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression analysis. It is different from traditional linear regression methods as it finds a hyperplane that best fits the data points in a continuous space, instead of fitting a line to the data points.

 **Important-Note:Explore the dataset once before getting through code.**

**So what are you waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you inside pull request section 😁😂 Thanks!**
