  **In this project we will build Support-Vector-Regression Model to the prediction of Salary from different features in Position_Salaries dataset**.<br></br>
  SVM regression or Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression analysis. It is different from traditional linear regression methods as it finds a hyperplane that best fits the data points in a continuous space, instead of fitting a line to the data points.In machine learning, Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. In Support Vector Regression, the straight line that is required to fit the data is referred to as hyperplane.

 **Important-Note:Explore the dataset once before getting through code.**

**So what are you waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you inside pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
